WE NEVER SWITCH MODES, ALWAYS IN SYSTEM MODE 


this version has AddressOf as well as &

and it returns the correct address for sub/functions (it wasn't before)

and CALL (expr) works

INTERRUPT SUB name ...

compiles the correct code (I think), but have not tested it other than to 
see you can't call a SUB defined as INTERRUPT, not sure it would work in 
C (when I get a chance I'll try it)

the interrupt routine does not do the below operation before exit (it 
will need to be done in BASIC, because not all LPC parts do it this way)

   VicVectorAddr = 0   // acknowledge and clear the interrupt

   
INT SETUP
disable INTERRUPTs , not with INTERRUPT OFF -- thats done in firmware and probably does not restore them the way you want
enable the interrupt bit
set VicVectorAddrX for whatever bit
re-enable interrupts
