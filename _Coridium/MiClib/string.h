DESCRIPTION

	(including the terminating null character) to the end of the

	<[src]> overwrites the null character at the end of <[dst]>.

DESCRIPTION
	This function finds the first occurence of <[c]> (converted to
	a char) in the string pointed to by <[string]> (including the
	terminating null character).

RETURNS
	Returns a pointer to the located character, or a null pointer
	if <[c]> does not occur in <[string]>.

DESCRIPTION
	<<strcmp>> compares the string at <[a]> to

RETURNS
	If <<*<[a]>>> sorts lexicographically after <<*<[b]>>>,
	<<strcmp>> returns a number greater than zero.  If the two
	strings match, <<strcmp>> returns zero.  If <<*<[a]>>>
	sorts lexicographically before <<*<[b]>>>, <<strcmp>> returns a
	number less than zero.

DESCRIPTION
	This function computes the length of the initial part of
	the string pointed to by <[s1]> which consists entirely of
	characters <[NOT]> from the string pointed to by <[s2]>
	(excluding the terminating null character).

RETURNS
	<<strcspn>> returns the length of the substring found.

DESCRIPTION
	The <<strlen>> function works out the length of the string
	starting at <<*<[str]>>> by counting chararacters until it
	reaches a <<NULL>> character.

RETURNS
	<<strlen>> returns the character count.

*/

DESCRIPTION
	<<strncat>> appends not more than <[length]> characters from
	the string pointed to by <[src]> (including the	terminating
	null character) to the end of the string pointed to by
	<[dst]>.  The initial character of <[src]> overwrites the null
	character at the end of <[dst]>.  A terminating null character
	is always appended to the result
	
WARNINGS
	Note that a null is always appended, so that if the copy is
	limited by the <[length]> argument, the number of characters
	appended to <[dst]> is <<n + 1>>.

RETURNS
	This function returns the initial value of <[dst]>

DESCRIPTION
	<<strncmp>> compares up to <[length]> characters
	from the string at <[a]> to the string at <[b]>.

RETURNS
	If <<*<[a]>>> sorts lexicographically after <<*<[b]>>>,
	<<strncmp>> returns a number greater than zero.  If the two
	strings are equivalent, <<strncmp>> returns zero.  If <<*<[a]>>>
	sorts lexicographically before <<*<[b]>>>, <<strncmp>> returns a

DESCRIPTION

	(excluding the terminating null  character).

RETURNS
